The former is widely applicable and rather stable, but suffers from low sample efficiency. By contrast, the latter is more sample efficient, but the most sample efficient variants are also rather unstable and highly sensitive to hyper-parameter setting. So far, these families of methods have mostly been compared as competing tools. However, an emerging approach consists in combining them so as to get the best of both worlds. Two previously existing combinations use either an ad hoc evolutionary algorithm or a goal exploration process together with the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm, a sample efficient off-policy deep RL algorithm. In this paper, we propose a different combination scheme using the simple cross-entropy\\nmethod (CEM) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3), another off-policy deep RL algorithm which improves over DDPG. We evaluate the resulting method, CEM-RL, on a set of benchmarks classically used in deep RL.\\n We show that CEM-RL benefits from several advantages over its competitors and offers a satisfactory trade-off between performance and sample efficiency. Policy search is the problem of finding a policy or controller maximizing some unknown utility function. Recently, research on policy search methods has witnessed a surge of interest due to the combination with deep neural networks, making it possible to find good enough continuous action policies in large domains. From one side, this combination gave rise to the emergence of efficient deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) techniques BID17 BID25 . From the other side, evolutionary methods, and particularly deep neuroevolution methods applying evolution strategies (ESs) to the parameters of a deep network have emerged as a competitive alternative to deep RL due to their higher parallelization capability BID23 .Both families of techniques have clear distinguishing properties. Evolutionary methods are significantly less sample efficient than deep RL methods because they learn from complete episodes, whereas deep RL methods use elementary steps of the system as samples, and thus exploit more information BID27 . In particular, off-policy deep RL algorithms can use a replay buffer to exploit the same samples as many times as useful, greatly improving sample efficiency. Actually, the sample efficiency of ESs can be improved using the \\\"importance mixing\\\" mechanism, but a recent study has shown that the capacity of importance mixing to improve sample efficiency by a factor of ten is still not enough to compete with off-policy deep RL BID22 . From the other side, sample efficient off-policy deep RL methods such as the DDPG algorithm BID17 are known to be unstable and highly sensitive to hyper-parameter setting. Rather than opposing both families as competing solutions to the policy search problem, a richer perspective consists in combining them so as to get the best of both worlds. As covered in Section 2, there are very few attempts in this direction so far. After presenting some background in Section 3, we propose in Section 4 a new combination method that combines the cross-entropy method (CEM) with DDPG or TD3, an off-policy deep RL algorithm which improves over DDPG. In Section 5, we investigate experimentally the properties of this CEM-RL method, showing its advantages both over the components taken separately and over a competing approach. Beyond the results of CEM-RL, the conclusion of this work is that there is still a lot of unexplored potential in new combinations of evolutionary and deep RL methods. Policy search is an extremely active research domain. The realization that evolutionary methods are an alternative to continuous action reinforcement learning and that both families share some similarity is not new BID29 b; 2013) but so far most works have focused on comparing them BID24 . Under this perspective, it was shown in BID6 that, despite its simplicity with respect to most deep RL methods, the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) was a strong baseline in policy search problems. Here, we focus on works which combine both families of methods. Synergies between evolution and reinforcement learning have already been investigated in the context of the so-called Baldwin effect BID28 . This literature is somewhat related to research on meta-learning, where one seeks to evolve an initial policy from which a self-learned reinforcement learning algorithm will perform efficient improvement (Wang et al., 2016; BID12 BID9 . The key difference with respect to the methods investigated here is that in this literature, the outcome of the RL process is not incorporated back into the genome of the agent, whereas here evolution and reinforcement learning update the same parameters in iterative sequences. Closer to ours, the work of BID3 sequentially applies a goal exploration process (GEP) to fill a replay buffer with purely exploratory trajectories and then applies DDPG to the resulting data. The GEP shares many similarities with evolutionary methods, though it focuses on diversity rather than on performance of the learned policies. The authors demonstrate on the Continuous Mountain Car and HALF-CHEETAH-V2 benchmarks that their combination, GEP-PG, is more sample-efficient than DDPG, leads to better final solutions and induces less variance during learning. However, due to the sequential nature of the combination, the GEP part does not benefit from the efficient gradient steps of the deep RL part. Another approach related to ours is the work of BID18 , where the authors introduce optimization problems with a surrogate gradient, i.e. a direction which is correlated with the real gradient. They show that by modifying the covariance matrix of an ES to incorporate the informations contained in the surrogate, a hybrid algorithm can be constructed. They provide a thorough theoretical investigation of their procedure, which they experimentally show capable of outperforming both a standard gradient descent method and a pure ES on several simple benchmarks. They argue that this method could be useful in RL, since surrogate gradients appear in Q-learning and actor-critic methods. However, a practical demonstration of those claims remains to be performed. Their approach resembles ours in that they use a gradient method to enhance an ES. But a notable difference is that they use the gradient information to directly change the distribution from which samples are drawn, whereas we use gradient information on the samples themselves, impacting the distribution only indirectly. The work which is the closest to ours is BID14 . The authors introduce an algorithm called ERL (for Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning), which is presented as an efficient combination of a deep RL algorithm, DDPG, and a population-based evolutionary algorithm. It takes the form of a population of actors, which are constantly mutated and selected in tournaments based on their fitness. In parallel, a single DDPG agent is trained from the samples generated by the evolutionary population. This single agent is then periodically inserted into the population. When the gradient-based policy improvement mechanism of DDPG is efficient, this individual outperforms its evolutionary siblings, it gets selected into the next generation and draws the whole population towards higher performance. Through their experiments, Khadka & Tumer demonstrate that this setup benefits from an efficient transfer of information between the RL algorithm and the evolutionary algorithm, and vice versa. However, their combination scheme does not make profit of the search efficiency of ESs. This is unfortunate because ESs are generally efficient evolutionary methods, and importance mixing can only be applied in their context to bring further sample efficiency improvement. By contrast with the works outlined above, the method presented here combines CEM and TD3 in such a way that our algorithm benefits from the gradient-based policy improvement mechanism of TD3, from the better stability of ESs, and may even benefit from the better sample efficiency brought by importance mixing, as described in Appendix B. In this section, we provide a quick overview of the evolutionary and deep RL methods used throughout the paper. Evolutionary algorithms manage a limited population of individuals, and generate new individuals randomly in the vicinity of the previous elite individuals. There are many variants of such algorithms, some using tournament selection as in BID14 , niche-based selection or more simply taking a fraction of elite individuals, see BID1 for a broader view. Evolution strategies can be seen as specific evolutionary algorithms where only one individual is retained from one generation to the next, this individual being the mean of the distribution from which new individuals are drawn. More specifically, an optimum individual is computed from the previous samples and the next samples are obtained by adding Gaussian noise to the current optimum. Finally, among ESs, Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs) are a specific family where the population is represented as a distribution using a covariance matrix \\u03a3 BID16 ). This covariance matrix defines a multivariate Gaussian function and samples at the next iteration are drawn according to \\u03a3. Along iterations, the ellipsoid defined by \\u03a3 is progressively adjusted to the top part of the hill corresponding to the local optimum \\u03b8 * . Various instances of EDAs, such as the CrossEntropy Method (CEM), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and PI 2 -CMA, are covered in BID29 b; 2013) . Here we focus on the first two. The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is a simple EDA where the number of elite individuals is fixed to a certain value K e (usually set to half the population). After all individuals of a population are evaluated, the K e fittest individuals are used to compute the new mean and variance of the population, from which the next generation is sampled after adding some extra variance to prevent premature convergence. In more details, each individual x i is sampled by adding Gaussian noise around the mean of the distribution \\u00b5, according to the current covariance matrix \\u03a3, i.e. x i \\u223c N (\\u00b5, \\u03a3). The problemdependent fitness of these new individuals (f i ) i=1,...,\\u03bb is computed, and the top-performing K e individuals, (z i ) i=1,... ,Ke are used to update the parameters of the distribution as follows: DISPLAYFORM0 (1) DISPLAYFORM1 where (\\u03bb i ) i=1,... ,Ke are weights given to the individuals, commonly chosen with BID10 . In the former, each individual is given the same importance, whereas the latter gives more importance to better individuals. BID0 . DISPLAYFORM2 A minor difference between CEM and CMA-ES can be found in the update of the covariance matrix. In its standard formulation, CEM uses the new estimate of the mean \\u00b5 to compute the new \\u03a3, whereas CMA-ES uses the current \\u00b5 (the one that was used to sample the current generation) as is the case in (2). We used the latter as BID10 shows it to be more efficient. The algorithm we are using can thus be described either as CEM using the current \\u00b5 for the estimation of the new \\u03a3, or as CMA-ES without evolutionary paths. The difference being minor, we still call the resulting algorithm CEM. Besides, we add some noise in the form of I to the usual covariance update to prevent premature convergence. We choose to have an exponentially decaying , by setting an initial and a final standard deviation, respectively \\u03c3 init and \\u03c3 end , initializing to \\u03c3 init and updating at each iteration with = \\u03c4 cem + (1 \\u2212 \\u03c4 cem )\\u03c3 end .Note that, in practice \\u03a3 can be too large for computing the updates and sampling new individuals. Indeed, if n denotes the number of actor parameters, simply sampling from \\u03a3 scales at least in O(n 2.3 ), which becomes quickly intractable. Instead, we constrain \\u03a3 to be diagonal. This means that in our computations, we replace the update in (2) by DISPLAYFORM3 where the square of the vectors denote the vectors of the square of the coordinates. The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) BID17 and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient (TD3) BID8 algorithms are two off-policy, actorcritic and sample efficient deep RL algorithms. The DDPG algorithm suffers from instabilities partly due to an overestimation bias in critic updates, and is known to be difficult to tune given its sensitivity to hyper-parameter settings. The availability of properly tuned code baselines incorporating several advanced mechanisms improves on the latter issue . The TD3 algorithm rather improves on the former issue, limiting the over-estimation bias by using two critics and taking the lowest estimate of the action values in the update mechanisms. As shown in FIG0 , the CEM-RL method combines CEM with either DDPG or TD3, giving rise to two algorithms named CEM-DDPG and CEM-TD3. The mean actor of the CEM population, referred to as \\u03c0 \\u00b5 , is first initialized with a random actor network. A unique critic network Q \\u03c0 managed by TD3 or DDPG is also initialized. At each iteration, a population of actors is sampled by adding Gaussian noise around the current mean \\u03c0 \\u00b5 , according to the current covariance matrix \\u03a3. Half of the resulting actors are directly evaluated. The corresponding fitness is computed as the cumulative reward obtained during an episode in the environment. Then, for each actor of the other half of the population, the critic is updated using this actor and, reciprocally, the actor follows the direction of the gradient given by the critic Q \\u03c0 for a fixed number of steps. The resulting actors are evaluated after this process. The CEM algorithm then takes the top-performing half of the resulting global population to compute its new \\u03c0 \\u00b5 and \\u03a3. The steps performed in the environment used to evaluate all actors in the population are fed into the replay buffer. The critic is trained from that buffer pro rata to the quantity of new information introduced in the buffer at the current generation. For instance, if the population contains 10 individuals, and if each episode lasts 1000 time steps, then 10,000 new samples are introduced in the replay buffer at each generation. The critic is thus trained for 10,000 mini-batches, which are divided into 2000 mini-batches per learning actor. This is a common practice in deep RL algorithms, where one mini-batch update is performed for each step of the actor in the environment. We also choose this number of steps (10,000) to be the number of gradient steps taken by half of the population at the next iteration. A pseudo-code of CEM-RL is provided in Algorithm 1.In cases where applying the gradient increases the performance of the actor, CEM benefits from this increase by incorporating the corresponding actors in its computations. By contrast, in cases where the gradient steps decrease performance, the resulting actors are ignored by CEM, which instead focuses on standard samples around \\u03c0 \\u00b5 . Those poor samples do not bring new insight on the current distribution of the CEM algorithm, since the gradient steps takes them away from the current distribution. However, since all evaluated actors are filling the replay buffer, the resulting experience is still fed to the critic and the future learning actors, providing some supplementary exploration. This approach generates a beneficial flow of information between the deep RL part and the evolutionary part. Indeed, on one hand, good actors found by following the current critic directly improve the evolutionary population. On the other hand, good actors found through evolution fill the replay buffer from which the RL algorithm learns. In that respect, our approach benefits from the same properties as the ERL algorithm BID14 ) depicted in FIG0 . But, by contrast with BID14 , gradient steps are directly applied to several samples, and using the CEM algorithm makes it possible to use importance mixing, as described in Appendix B. Another difference is that in CEM-RL gradient steps are applied at each iteration whereas in ERL, a deep RL actor is only injected to the population from time to time. One can also see from FIG0 that, in contrast to ERL, CEM-RL does not use any deep RL actor. Other distinguishing properties between ERL and CEM-RL are discussed in the light of empirical results in Section 5.2.Finally, given that CMA-ES is generally considered as more sophisticated than CEM, one may wonder why we did not use CMA-ES instead of CEM into the CEM-RL algorithm. Actually, the key contribution of CMA-ES with respect to CEM consists of the evolutionary path mechanism (see Section 3.2), but this mechanism results in some inertia in \\u03a3 updates, which resists to the beneficial effect of applying RL gradient steps. In this section, we study the CEM-RL algorithm to answer the following questions:\\u2022 How does the performance of CEM-RL compare to that of CEM and TD3 taken separately?What if we remove the CEM mechanism, resulting in a multi-actor TD3?

What are the main factors explaining the difference between both algorithms?Additionally, in Appendices B to E, we investigate other aspects of the performance of CEM-RL such as the impact of importance mixing, the addition of action noise or the use of the tanh non-linearity. In order to investigate the above questions, we evaluate the corresponding algorithms in several continuous control tasks simulated with the MUJOCO physics engine and commonly used as policy search benchmarks: HALF-CHEETAH-V2, HOPPER-V2, WALKER2D-V2, SWIMMER-V2 and ANT-V2 BID2 .We implemented CEM-RL with the PYTORCH library 1 . We built our code around the DDPG and TD3 implementations given by the authors of the TD3 algorithm 2 . For the ERL implementation, we used one given by the authors 3 .Unless specified otherwise, each curve represents the average over 10 runs of the corresponding quantity, and the variance corresponds to the 68% confidence interval for the estimation of the mean. In all learning performance figures, dotted curves represent medians and the x-axis represents the total number of steps actually performed in the environment, to highlight potential sample efficiency effects, particularly when using importance mixing (see Appendix B).Architectures of the networks are described in Appendix A. Most TD3 and DDPG hyper-parameters were reused from BID8 . The only notable difference is the use of tanh non linearities instead of RELU in the actor network, after we spotted that the latter performs better than the former on several environments. We trained the networks with the Adam optimizer BID15 , with a learning rate of 1e \\u22123 for both the actor and the critic. The discount rate \\u03b3 was set to 0.99, and the target weight \\u03c4 to 5e \\u22123 . All populations contained 10 actors, and the standard deviations \\u03c3 init , \\u03c3 end and the constant \\u03c4 cem of the CEM algorithm were respectively set to 1e \\u22123 , 1e \\u22125 and 0.95. Finally, the size of the replay buffer was set to 1e 6 , and the batch size to 100. We first compare CEM-TD3 to TD3, TD3 and a multi-actor variant of TD3, then CEM-RL to ERL based on several benchmarks. A third section is devoted to additional results which have been rejected in appendices to comply with space constraints. In this section, we compare CEM-TD3 to three baselines: our variant of CEM, TD3 and a multi-actor variant of TD3. For TD3 and its multi-actor variant, we report the average of the score of the agent over 10 episodes for every 5000 steps performed in the environment. For CEM and CEM-TD3, we report after each generation the average of the score of the new average individual of the population over 10 episodes. From FIG1 , one can see that CEM-TD3 outperforms CEM and TD3 on HALF-CHEETAH-V2, HOPPER-V2 and WALKER2D-V2. On most benchmarks, CEM-TD3 also displays slightly less variance than TD3. Further results in Appendix G show that on ANT-V2, CEM-TD3 outperforms CEM and is on par with TD3. More surprisingly, CEM outperforms all other algorithms on SWIMMER-V2, as covered in Appendix E.One may wonder whether the good performance of CEM-TD3 mostly comes from its \\\"ensemble method\\\" nature BID19 . Indeed, having a population of actors improves exploration and stabilizes performances by filtering out instabilities that can appear during learning. To answer this question, we performed an ablative study where we removed the CEM mechanism. We considered a population of 5 actors initialized as in CEM-TD3, but then just following the gradient given by the TD3 critic. This algorithm can be seen as a multi-actor TD3 where all actors share the same critic. We reused the hyper-parameters described in Section 5.2. From FIG1 , one can see that CEM-TD3 outperforms more or less significantly multi-actor TD3 on all benchmarks, which clearly suggests that the evolutionary part contributes to the performance of CEM-TD3.As a summary, In this section, we compare CEM-RL to ERL. The ERL method using DDPG rather than TD3, we compare it to both CEM-DDPG and CEM-TD3. This makes it possible to isolate the effect of the combination scheme from the improvement brought by TD3 itself. Results are shown in FIG2 . We let ERL learn for the same number of steps as in Khadka & Tumer, namely 2 millions on HALF-CHEETAH-V2 and SWIMMER-V2, 4 millions on HOPPER-V2, 6 millions on ANT-V2 and 10 millions on WALKER2D-V2. However, due to limited computational resources, we stop learning with both CEM-RL methods after 1 million steps, hence the constant performance after 1 million steps. Our results slightly differ from those of the ERL paper BID14 . We explain this difference by two factors. First, the authors only average their results over 5 different seeds, whereas we used 10 seeds. Second, the released implementation of ERL may be slightly different from the one used to produce the published results 4 , raising again the reproducibility issue recently discussed in the reinforcement learning literature BID11 . FIG2 shows that after performing 1 million steps, both CEM-RL methods outperform ERL on HALF-CHEETAH-V2, HOPPER-V2 and WALKER2D-V2. We can also see that CEM-TD3 outperforms CEM-DDPG on WALKER2D-V2. On ANT-V2, CEM-DDPG and ERL being on par after 1 million steps, we increased the number of learning steps in CEM-DDPG to 6 millions. The corresponding results are shown in FIG0 in Appendix G. Results on SWIMMER-V2 are covered in Appendix E. Table 2 : Final performance of ERL, CEM-DDPG and CEM-TD3 on 5 environments. We report the mean ands medians over 10 runs of 1 million steps. For each benchmark, we highlight the results of the method with the best mean. One can see that, beyond outperforming ERL, CEM-TD3 outperforms CEM-DDPG on most benchmarks, in terms of final performance, convergence speed, and learning stability. This is especially true for hard environments such as WALKER2D-V2 and ANT-V2. The only exception in SWIMMER-V2, as studied in Appendix E. Table 2 gives the final best results of methods used in this Section. The overall conclusion is that CEM-RL generally outperforms ERL. In this section, we outline the main messages arising from further studies that have been rejected in appendices in order to comply with space constraints. In Appendix B, we investigate the influence of the importance mixing mechanism over the evolution of performance, for CEM and CEM-RL. Results show that importance mixing has a limited impact on the sample efficiency of CEM-TD3 on the benchmarks studied here, in contradiction with results from BID22 obtained using various standard evolutionary strategies. The fact that the covariance matrix \\u03a3 moves faster with CEM-RL may explain this result, as it prevents the reuse of samples. In Appendix C, we analyze the effect of adding Gaussian noise to the actions of CEM-TD3. Unlike what BID14 suggested using ERL, we did not find any conclusive evidence that action space noise improves performance with CEM-TD3. This may be due to the fact that, as further studied in Appendix D, the evolutionary algorithm in ERL tends to converge to a unique individual, hence additional noise is welcome, whereas evolutionary strategies like CEM more easily maintain some exploration. Indeed, we further investigate the different dynamics of parameter space exploration provided by the ERL and CEM-TD3 algorithms in Appendix D. FIG6 and 7 show that the evolutionary population in ERL tends to collapse towards a single individual, which does not happen with the CEM population due to the sampling method. In Appendix E, we highlight the fact that, on the SWIMMER-V2 benchmark, the performance of the algorithms studied in this paper varies a lot from the performance obtained on other benchmarks. The most likely explanation is that, in SWIMMER-V2, any deep RL method provides a deceptive gradient information which is detrimental to convergence towards efficient actor parameters. In this particular context, ERL better resists to detrimental gradients than CEM-RL, which suggests to design a version of ERL using CEM to improve the population instead of its ad hoc evolutionary algorithm. Finally, in Appendix F, we show that using a tanh non-linearity in the architecture of actors often results in significantly stronger performance than using RELU. This strongly suggests performing \\\"neural architecture search\\\" (Zoph & Le, 2016; BID7 in the context of RL. We advocated in this paper for combining evolutionary and deep RL methods rather than opposing them. In particular, we have proposed such a combination, the CEM-RL method, and showed that in most cases it was outperforming not only some evolution strategies and some sample efficient offpolicy deep RL algorithms, but also another combination, the ERL algorithm. Importantly, despite being mainly an evolutionary method, CEM-RL is competitive to the state-of-the-art even when considering sample efficiency, which is not the case of other deep neuroevolution methods BID24 .Beyond these positive performance results, our study raises more fundamental questions. First, why does the simple CEM algorithm perform so well on the SWIMMER-V2 benchmark? Then, our empirical study of importance mixing did not confirm a clear benefit of using it, neither did the effect of adding noise on actions. We suggest explanations for these phenomena, but nailing down the fundamental reasons behind them will require further investigations. Such deeper studies will also help understand which properties are critical in the performance and sample efficiency of policy search algorithms, and define even more efficient policy search algorithms in the future. As suggested in Section 5.2.3, another avenue for future work will consist in designing an ERL algorithm based on CEM rather than on an ad hoc evolutionary algorithm. Finally, given the impact of the neural architecture on our results, we believe that a more systemic search of architectures through techniques such as neural architecture search (Zoph & Le, 2016; BID7 may provide important progress in performance of deep policy search algorithms.

We would like to thank Thomas Pierrot for fruitful discussions. A ARCHITECTURE OF THE NETWORKS Our network architectures are very similar to the ones described in BID8 . In particular, the size of the layers remains the same. The only differences resides in the non-linearities. Importance mixing is a specific mechanism designed to improve the sample efficiency of evolution strategies. It was initially introduced in Sun et al. FORMULA1 and consisted in reusing some samples from the previous generation into the current one, to avoid the cost of re-evaluating the corresponding policies in the environment. The mechanism was recently extended in BID22 to reusing samples from any generation stored into an archive. Empirical results showed that importance sampling can improve sample efficiency by a factor of ten, and that most of these savings just come from using the samples from the previous generation, as performed by the initial mechanism. A pseudo-code of the importance mixing mechanism is given in Algorithm 2.In CEM, importance mixing is implemented as described in BID22 . By contrast, some adaptation is required in CEM-RL. Actors which take gradient steps can no longer be regarded as sampled from the current distribution of the CEM algorithm. We thus choose to apply importance mixing only to the half of the population which does not receive gradient steps from the RL critic. In practice, only actors which do not take gradient steps are inserted into the actor archive and can be replaced with samples from previous generations. From Figure 4 , one can see that in the CEM case, importance mixing introduces some minor instability, without noticeably increasing sample efficiency. On HALF-CHEETAH-V2, SWIMMER-V2 and WALKER2D-V2, performance even decreases when using importance mixing. For CEM-RL, the effect varies greatly from environment to environment, but the gain in sample reuse is almost null if min(1, DISPLAYFORM0 Append z i to the current generation g new 7:Draw z i according to the current pdf p(., \\u03b8 new )8: DISPLAYFORM1 Append z i to the current generation g new 10:size = |g new | if size \\u2265 N : go to 1212: if size > N : remove a randomly chosen sample 13: if size < N : fill the generation sampling from p(. , DISPLAYFORM0 Figure 4: Learning curves of CEM-TD3 and CEM with and without importance mixing on the HALF-CHEETAH-V2, HOPPER-V2, WALKER2D-V2, SWIMMER-V2 and ANT-V2 benchmarks.as well, though an increase in performance can be seen on SWIMMER-V2. The latter fact is consistent with the finding that the gradient steps are not useful in this environment (see Appendix E). On HOPPER-V2 and HALF-CHEETAH-V2, results with and without importance mixing seem to be equivalent. On WALKER2D-V2, importance mixing decreases final performance. On ANT-V2, importance mixing seems to accelerate learning in the beginning, but final performances are equivalent to those of CEM-RL. Thus importance mixing seems to have a limited impact in CEM-TD3.This conclusion seems to contradict the results obtained in BID22 . This may be due to different things. First, the dimensions of the search spaces in the experiments here are much larger than those studied in BID22 , which might deteriorate the estimation of the covariance matrices when samples are too correlated. the ones used in BID22 . In particular, we can see from FIG1 that CEM is far from solving the environments over one million steps. Perhaps a study over a longer time period would make importance mixing relevant again. Besides, by reusing old samples, the importance mixing mechanism somehow hinders exploration (since we evaluate less new individuals), which might be detrimental in the case of MUJOCO environments. Finally, and most importantly, the use of RL gradient steps accelerates the displacement of the covariance matrix, resulting in fewer opportunities for sample reuse. In BID14 , the authors indicate that one reason for the efficiency of their approach is that the replay buffer of DDPG gets filled with two types of noisy experiences. On one hand, the buffer gets filled with noisy interactions of the DDPG actor with the environment. This is usually referred to as action space noise. On the other hand, actors with different parameters also fill the buffer, which is more similar to parameter space noise . In CEM-RL, we only use parameter space noise, but it would also be possible to add action space noise. To explore this direction, each actor taking gradient steps performs a noisy episode in the environment. We report final results after 1 million steps in TAB9 . Learning curves are available in FIG5 . Unlike what BID14 suggested, we did not find any conclusive evidence that action space noise improves performance. In CEM-TD3, the CEM part seems to explore enough of the action space on its own. It seems that sampling performed in CEM results in sufficient exploration and performs better than adding simple Gaussian noise to the actions. This highlights a difference between using an evolutionary strategy like CEM and an evolutionary algorithm as done in ERL. Evolutionary algorithms tend to converge to a unique individual whereas evolutionary strategies more easily maintain some exploration. These aspects are further studied in Appendix D. In this section, we highlight the difference in policy parameter update dynamics in CEM-RL and ERL. FIG6 displays the evolution of the first two parameters of actor networks during training with CEM-RL and ERL on HALF-CHEETAH-V2. For ERL, we plot the chosen parameters of the DDPG actor with a continuous line, and represent those of the evolutionary actors with dots. For CEM-RL, we represent the chosen parameters of sampled actors with dots, and the gradient steps based on the TD3 critic with continuous lines. The same number of dots is represented for both algorithms. One can see that, in ERL the evolutionary population tends to be much less diverse that in CEM-RL. There are many redundancies in the parameters (dots with the same coordinates), and the population seems to converge to a single individual. On the other hand, there is no such behavior in CEM-RL where each generation introduces completely new samples. As a consequence, parameter space exploration looks better in the CEM-RL algorithm. To further study this loss of intra-population diversity in ERL, we perform 10 ERL runs and report in FIG7 an histogram displaying the distribution of the population-wise similarity with respect to the populations encountered during learning. We measure this similarity as the average percentage of parameters shared between two different individuals of the said population. The results indicate that around 55% of populations encountered during a run of ERL display a population-similarity of above 80%. Results are averaged over 10 runs. As usual, the variance corresponds to the 68% confidence interval for the estimation of the mean. One can also see the difference in how both methods use the gradient information of their respective deep RL part. In the case of ERL, the parameters of the population concentrate around those of the DDPG actor. Each 10 generations, its parameters are introduced into the population, and since DDPG is already efficient alone on HALF-CHEETAH-V2, those parameters quickly spread into the population. Indeed, according to BID14 , the resulting DDPG actor is the elite of the population 80% of the time, and is introduced into the population 98% of the time. This integration is however passive: the direction of exploration does not vary much after introducing the DDPG agent. CEM-RL integrates this gradient information differently. The short lines emerging from dots, which represent gradient steps performed by half of the actors, act as scouts. Once CEM becomes aware of better solutions that can be found in a given direction, the sampling of the next population is modified so as to favor this promising direction. CEM is thus pro-actively exploring in the good directions it has been fed with. Experiments on the SWIMMER-V2 benchmark give results that differ a lot from the results on other benchmarks, hence they are covered separately here. Figure8a shows that CEM outperforms TD3, CEM-TD3, multi-actor TD3. Besides, as shown in FIG8 , ERL outperforms CEM-DDPG, which itself outperforms CEM-TD3. All these findings seem to show that being better at RL makes you worse at SWIMMER-V2. The most likely explanation is that, in SWIMMER-V2, any deep RL method provides a deceptive gradient information which is detrimental to convergence towards efficient actor parameters. This conclusion could already be established from the results of BID14 , where the evolution algorithm alone produced results on par with the ERL algorithm, showing that RL-based actors were just ignored. In this particular context, the actors using TD3 gradient being deteriorated by the deceptive gradient effect, CEM-RL is behaving as a CEM with only half a population, thus it is less efficient than the standard CEM algorithm. By contrast, ERL better resists than CEM-RL to the same issue. Indeed, if the actor generated by DDPG does not perform better than the evolutionary population, then this actor is just ignored, and the evolutionary part behaves as usual, without any loss in performance. In practice, Khadka & Tumer note that on SWIMMER-V2, the DDPG actor was rejected 76% of the time. Finally, by comparing CEM and ERL from FIG8 and FIG8 , one can conclude that on this benchmark, the evolutionary part of ERL behaves on par with CEM alone. This is at odds with premature convergence effects seen in the evolutionary part of ERL, as studied in more details in Appendix D. From all these insights, the SWIMMER-V2 environment appears particularly interesting, as we are not aware of any deep RL method capable of solving it quickly and reliably. In this section, we explore the impact on performance of the type of non-linearities used in the actor of CEM-TD3. TAB9 reports the results of CEM-TD3 using RELU non-linearities between the linear layers, instead of tanh. Figure 9 displays the learning performance of CEM-TD3 and CEM on benchmarks, using either the RELU or the tanh nonlinearity in the actors. Results indicate that on some benchmarks, changing from tanh to RELU can cause a huge drop in performance. This is particularly obvious in the ANT-V2 benchmark, where the average performance drops by 46%. FIG9 (f) shows that, for the CEM algorithm on the SWIMMER-V2 benchmark, using RELU also causes a 60% performance drop. As previously reported in the literature BID11 , this study suggests that network architectures can have a large impact on performance. G ADDITIONAL RESULTS ON ANT-V2 FIG0 represents the learning performance of CEM, TD3, multi-actor TD3, CEM-DDPG and CEM-TD3 on the ANT-V2 benchmark. It is discussed in the main text.\",\n          \"The Pareto (P) distribution is very versatile, and a variety of uncertainties can be usefully modelled by it. It has several applications in actuarial science, economics, finance, life testing, survival analysis and telecommunications because of its heavy tail properties. The probability density function (pdf) and cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the P distribution are given (for x > b) by:where b > 0 is a scale parameter and a > 0 is a shape parameter. This distribution is a special form of the Pearson Type VI distribution. Since the P distribution has a reversed-J pdf shape and a decreasing hazard rate function (hrf), it may sometimes be insufficient to model data. Generally, practical problems require a wider range of possibilities for the medium risk, for example when the lifetime data present a bathtub-shaped hrf, such as human mortality and machine life cycles. For this reason, researchers developed various extensions and modified forms of the P distribution to obtain a more flexible model with different numbers of parameters. Some of them can be cited as follows: Exponentiated P (EP) (Stoppa 1990; Gupta 1998), Beta P (BP) (Akinsete 2008), Kumaraswamy P (KwP) (Bourguignon 2013), Kumaraswamy generalized P (Nadarajah and Eljabri 2013), P ArcTan (PAT) (Gomez-Deniz and Calderin-Ojeda 2015), exponentiated Weibull P ) and Weibull PThis generator can supply the flexibility of pdf and hrf to any baseline distribution model. In this report, we introduce a new extended P distribution, called the Burr X Pareto (BXP) model, based on the BX-G family. With this idea, we construct the new BXP distribution as more flexible than the P distribution and provide a comprehensive description of some of its mathematical properties. We prove empirically that the BXP model provides better fits than some extensions and generalizations of the P, some of which have one extra model parameter, and the others have the same number of parameters, by means of two applications to real data. We hope that the new distribution will attract wider applications in reliability, engineering and other areas of research. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we define the BXP model. In Section 3, we provide a useful mixture representation for its pdf. In Section 4, we derive some of its general mathematical properties. Some estimation methods of the model parameters are performed in Section 5. In Section 6, simulation results to assess the performance of the proposed maximum likelihood estimation procedure are discussed. In Section 7, we provide two applications to real data to illustrate the importance and flexibility of the new family. Value-at-Risk estimation with the BXP distribution is presented in Section 8. Finally, some concluding remarks are presented in Section 9. In this section, we define the BXP model and provide some plots for its pdf and hrf. The BXP cdf is given by:The pdf corresponding to (3) is given by:Lemma 1 provides random number generations from the BXP and some relations and of the BXP distribution with the well-known Burr X and uniform distributions. Lemma 1. (a) If a random variable Y follows the Burr X distribution with shape parameter d and scale parameter one, then the random variable X = b(1 + Y) (1/a) follows the BXP(d, a, b) distribution. (b) If a random variable Y follows the uniform distribution on [0,1], then the random variable:Proof. The proofs of (a) and (b) are obtained by the transformation method. The hrf, reversed hazard rate function and cumulative hazard rate function of X are given, respectively, by:and:In Figure 1, we sketched the possible pdf and hrf shapes of the BXP distribution for some selected parameter values. Figure 1 shows that the BXP distribution has various pdf and hrf shapes. d=3,a=2. 5,b=0. 5 d=4,a=2. 5,b=0. 5 d=5,a=2. 5,b=0. 5 d=6,a=2. 5,b=0. 5 d=7a=2. 5,b=0. 5 In this section, we provide a very useful linear representation for the BXP density function. If |z| < 1 and b > 0 is a real non-integer, the power series holds:For simplicity, ignoring the dependence of G(x) and g(x) on x and applying (5) to (4), we have:Applying the power series to the term exp -(i + 1) x b a - 1 2 , Equation (6) becomes:Consider the series expansion:Applying the expansion in (8) to (7) for the term x b -a(2j+3), Equation (7) becomes:where:and:Equation (9) reveals that the density of X can be expressed as expansions of the EP densities. Therefore, several mathematical properties of the new family can be obtained by knowing those of the EP distribution. Similarly, the cdf of the BXP family can also be expressed as a mixture of EP cdfs given by:where:is the cdf of the EP family with power parameter 2(j + 1) + k. In this section, we will provide some mathematical properties of the BXP distribution. The r-th ordinary moment of X is given by u r = E(X r ) = [?] -[?] x r f (x)dx. By using Equation (9), we obtain:is the r-th ordinary moment of EP distribution with power parameter 2(j + 1) + k. The j-th order central moment can be obtained by the following relationship:For the skewness and kurtosis coefficients, we have:The values for mean, variance, b 1 and b 2 for selected values of d, a and b are shown in Table 1. We can say that the BXP model can be useful for various data modelling in terms of skewness and kurtosis. The n-th moment of the residual life, say m n (t) = E[(X - t) n | X > t], n = 1, 2,. . . , uniquely determines F(x). The n-th moment of the residual life of X is given by:where:is the incomplete beta function. The Mean Residual Life (MRL) function or the life expectation at age t defined by m 1 (t) = E[(X - t) | X > t] follows by setting n = 1 in the last equation. The n-th moment of the reversed residual life, say M n (t) = E[(t - X) n | X <= t] for t > 0 and n = 1, 2,. . . uniquely determines F(x). We obtain:Then, the n-th moment of the reversed residual life of X becomes:The mean inactivity time (MIT) or mean waiting time is given by, and it can be obtained easily by setting n = 1 in the above equation. Order statistics make their appearance in many areas of statistical theory and practice. Let X 1 ,. . . , X n be a random sample from the BXP of distributions, and let X (1) ,. . . , X (n) be the corresponding order statistics. The pdf of the i-th order statistic, say X i:n , can be written as:Using (3), (4) and (10), we get:where:The pdf of X i:n can be expressed as:Then, the density function of the BXP order statistics is a mixture of EP densities. Based on the last equation, we note that the properties of X i:n follow from those properties of Y 2w+k+2. For example, the moments of X i:n can be expressed as: In this section, we consider the maximum likelihood, least square and weighted least square estimation of the parameters of the BXP distribution. We consider the estimation of the unknown parameters of the BXP model from complete samples by the maximum likelihood method. The maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the parameters of the BXP (d, a, b) model are now discussed. Let x 1 ,. . . , x n be a random sample of this distribution with parameter vector Th = (d, a, b). The log-likelihood function for d is given by:The last equation can be also maximized either by using the different programs such as R (optim function), SAS (PROC NLMIXED) or by solving the nonlinear likelihood equations obtained by differentiating. We note that since x [?] (b, [?]), the MLE of the b parameter cannot be obtained in the usual way. Hence, the MLE of b is the first order statistic X (1) (Johnson 1994). The components of the score vector,, are:and:For fixed b, the interval estimation of the model parameters requires the 2 x 2 observed information matrix J(Th) = {J ij } for i, j = d, a. The multivariate normal N 2 (0, J( Th) -1 ) distribution, under standard regularity conditions, can be used to provide approximate confidence intervals for the unknown parameters, where J( Th) is the total observed information matrix evaluated at Th. Then, approximate 100(1 - d)% confidence intervals for d and a can be determined by: d +- z z/2 J dd and a +- z z/2 J aa , where z z/2 is the upper z-th percentile of the standard normal model. In this section, we use the least square (LS) and weighted least square (WLS) estimators (Swain 1988) to estimate the parameters of the BXP distribution. Let X (1) ,. . . , X (n) be the order statistics of a random sample of size n from the BXP defined in (4), then the least square estimators (LSEs) of the unknown parameters d, a and b of the BXP distribution can be obtained by minimizing:with respect to unknown parameters d, a and b. The weighted least square estimators (WLSEs) of the unknown parameters d, a and b follow by minimizing:with respect to unknown parameters d, a and b. Here, we perform the simulation study for MLEs of the BXP distribution. We generate N = 1000 samples of sizes n = 50, 100, 200 from selected BXP distributions. The random numbers generation is simulated by:where u is a uniform random number on [0,1]. We also calculate the empirical mean, standard deviations (sd), bias and mean square error (MSE) of the MLEs. The empirical bias and MSE are calculated by:All results of MLEs were obtained using the optim-CG routine in the R programme. The empirical results of this simulation study are reported in Table 2. Table 2 shows that when the sample size increases, the empirical means approach the true parameter value. For the same case, the standard deviations, biases and MSEs decrease in all the cases as expected. Therefore, the MLE method works very well to estimate the model parameters of the BXP distribution. In this section, we present two applications based on the real datasets to show the flexibility of the BXP distribution. The BXP model is compared with the WP, BP, KwP, PAT and P distributions. The cdfs of the above distributions are given (for x > b and a, a, d > 0) by:and:In order to see the best model, we obtain the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), Corrected Akaike Information Criterion (CAIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion (HQIC) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness of-fit statistic to see the fitting of the models to dataset. In general, the best model can be chose as the one that has the smallest values of the AIC, CAIC, BIC, HQIC and KS statistics. All computations of the MLEs are performed by the maxLik routine in the R program. The first dataset gives the survival times, in weeks, of 33 patients suffering from acute myelogenous leukaemia. These data have been introduced by Feigl and Zelen and analysed by Mead. The data are: 65, 156, 100, 134, 16, 108, 121, 4, 39, 143, 56, 26, 22, 1, 1, 5, 65, 56, 65, 17, 7, 16, 22, 3, 4, 2, 3, 8, 4, 3, 30, 4, 43. This dataset is well known as being bathtub hrf-shaped. The second data-set shows the time intervals of the successive earthquakes in the last century in the North Anatolia fault zone between 39. 00 * to 42. 00 * north latitude and 39. 00 * to 40. 00 * east longitude. This dataset was introduced and analysed by Kus. This dataset is well known as being decreasing hrf-shaped. For both datasets, the estimated parameters based on the MLE method are given in Table 3, whereas the values of the information criteria and goodness-of-fit statistics are given in Table 4. Since MLE of the b equals the minimum order statistics, we suppose it as known to be the minimum value the dataset. Table 4 shows that the BXP distribution has the lowest values of these statistics among all the fitted models. Hence, it could be chosen as the best model under these criteria for both datasets. The histogram of these datasets and the estimated pdfs and cdfs of the application models are displayed in Figures 2 and 3. From the this figure, we show that the BXP model provides the best fit to these datasets as compared to other models. In this section, the performance of BXP distribution in estimating Value-at-Risk (VaR) is discussed and compared with the Generalized P (GP) distribution. GP is a widely-used distribution in actuarial sciences, economics and statistics to model the tail of the distribution that contains extreme events. VaR is one of the most popular approaches to measure market risk. From a statistical point of view, the VaR entails the estimation of the quantile of the distribution of returns. The VaR for a long position (left tail of the distribution function) over a given time horizon tis defined as:where F is the distribution function of financial losses, F -1 denotes the inverse of F and p is the quantile at which VaR is calculated. The Peaks-Over-Threshold (POT) method is used to model the tail of the distribution. POT is based on the distribution of exceedances over a given threshold. The conditional excess distribution, F u , can be defined as follows:where random variable X represents the financial losses, u is the threshold, y = X - u are the excesses and x F <= [?] is the right endpoint of F. F u (y) can be re-defined as follows:The Balkema and De Haan and Pickands theorem shows that for a sufficiently high threshold u, the excess distribution function F u can be approximated by the GP distribution:where y >= 0 for x >= 0 and 0 <= y <= s x for x < 0 and x and s are shape and scale parameters of the GP distribution, respectively. Isolating F(x) from (14), we get:where F u (y) is the GP distribution and F(u) = (n - N u ) n. Then, substituting (14) in (16), the following estimate for F(x) is obtained:wherex ands are maximum likelihood estimates of x and s, respectively. Inverting (17) for a given probability p, VaR p can be obtained as:Threshold selection is a difficult task and an essential part for tail modelling with the GP distribution. The most used method is the Mean Excess (ME) plot for the determination of the threshold. The ME function can be defined as follows:where I is the indicator function. When the empirical ME function is a positively sloped straight line above a certain threshold u, it is evidence that the used dataset follows the GP distribution with a positive x parameter. Here, the BXP distribution is adopted in the POT method. It is assumed that BXP provides a good approximation to F u (y) for a sufficiently high threshold u. Then, substituting the cdf of BXP in (16), the new estimate for F(x) can be obtained as:The VaR p can be obtained by inverting (20) for a given probability p, as follows:whereb,d anda are the maximum likelihood estimates of b, d and a, respectively. To evaluate and compare the performance of the BXP with GP distribution in terms of VaR accuracy, the S and P-500 index is used. The used time series data contain 1465 daily log returns from 4 January 2012 to 27 October 2017. The descriptive statistics of S and P-500 are given in Table 4. Table 5 shows that the mean returns are closed to zero. The Jarque-Bera statistics in Table 5 also show that the null hypothesis of normality is rejected at any level of significance, as evidenced by the high excess kurtosis and negative skewness. Thus, it is clear that log returns of S and P-500 indexes have non-normal characteristics, excess kurtosis and fat tails. The result of the Ljung-Box test indicates that the raw returns are free from autocorrelation. Therefore, BXP and GP distributions could be applied to the independent and identically distributed observations. The ME plot is used to determine the optimal threshold value for the POT method. Figure 4 displays the ME plot of the S and P-500 dataset. The optimal threshold could be chosen as 0. 02 for the used dataset. It is near the 90% quantile value of the S and P-500. Table 6 shows the estimated parameters of BXP distribution and GP distribution using the POT method for the S and P-500 dataset. Based on the figures in Table 6, we conclude that since the BXP distribution has the lowest values of these statistics, BXP provides better fits than the GP distribution for tail modelling of S and P-500 indexes. Figure 5 displays the fitted pdf and cdfs of the BXP and GP distributions. Figure 5 reveals that the BXP distribution provides superior fits to the used dataset. Table 6. MLEs, corresponding standard errors (in second line) and goodness-of-fit statistics for the S and P-500. Parameters Goodness-of-Fit Here, VaR is estimated with the GP and BXP distribution using the POT method for values of p = 0. 95, 0. 975 and 0. 99. The rolling window estimation method is used to evaluate the out-of-sample performance of the GP and BXP models. The first 1064 daily returns are used as the window length, and the next 400 data points are considered as out-of-sample period. Figure 6 displays daily VaR estimates of the BXP and GP models. Based on Figure 6, it is clear that the BXP and GP models produce similar VaR estimates. Therefore, the BXP model could be considered as an alternative VaR model against to GP model for financial institutions. In VaR estimation, using the POT method is applied to raw return data assuming the distribution to be stationary or unconditional without considering the time-varying volatility. The POT method can also be considered as a dynamic model, where the conditional distribution of F is taken into account and the volatility of returns is captured. The dynamic POT method based on the BXP distribution, combined with the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity type process, introduced by Bollerslev , could be considered as future work of this analysis. In this analysis, we proposed a new distribution that was referred to as the Burr X Pareto (BXP) using the Burr X generator. Some mathematical properties were obtained. The estimation of the model parameters is performed by the MLE, LS and WLS methods. We compare the distribution with a few other models using two real datasets. It is expected that the BXP distribution will serve as a better alternative in modelling real-life datasets. Value-at-Risk estimation with the BXP distribution is presented using time series data, we showed that the new model could be considered as an alternative VaR model against the generalized Pareto model for financial institutions. \\n\",\n          \"Climate change is one of the core issues in the modern world and has economic, cultural, and ecological impacts on the society. Since the industrial revolution, fossil fuels consumption has increased the carbon emission which is one of the main roots of global warming and climate change in the world. Carbon emissions are being used as a proxy for environmental degradation in empirical studies. The reason for this is that carbon emissions have a historical link with economic growth. However, the question arises why countries had different levels of carbon emissions per capita for the similar level of income per capita? To find a correct answer to this critical question, many studies have been attempted to study the nexus between environmental degradation and economic growth along with other important variables which fit in the context. The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is currently a standard feature in the scientific literature of environmental policy. This hypothesis shows an inverted U-shape nexus between environmental degradation and income level. The urbanization process may be identified as a critical determinant of economic growth and structure of the economy. However, extensive urbanization is a recent phenomenon, and is among those that have been identified as an advanced process of modern economic development. Although there is a high relationship between urbanization and economic growth, it is a difficult task to decide whether economic growth causes urbanization or urbanization causes economic growth. On the other hand, the urbanization process may increase the commercial energy consumption and carbon emissions [13,14]. Several studies have included urbanization as factors of environmental degradation in both developing and developed economies [13,15]. Urbanization has positive as well as negative effects on the environment. The impact of urbanization on the environment differs with the level of development. Several studies have observed a positive relationship between urbanization and carbon emissions [17,18]. Katircioglua and Katircioglub pointed out that traditional fuel energy consumption related to urban development is a key path of carbon dioxide emissions. Also, Wu documented that the urbanization process and energy intensifies the level of carbon emissions in the environment. Aggregate energy consumption and greenhouse emissions are positively correlated with the urbanization process as the result of higher living standards in urban life. Urban citizens frequently attempt to consume high energy intensive goods. Thus, modern urban lifestyles lead to increase direct and indirect energy consumption and as a consequence lead to the global warming and climate change. Also, urbanization is always the core of the socio-economic development of an economy. All hubs of economic development process such as finance, communication, and transportations are located in the cities. Conversely, urban life is always dynamic, and energy consumption is significantly higher in urban areas than rural areas. Thus, energy consumption in an urban area has a direct effect on environmental quality and urbanization is considered to be one of the leading elements in the estimation of future carbon emissions in the world. International Energy Agency reported that urban areas are globally responsible for 71% of worldwide carbon emissions while some scholars recently documented that urbanization is responsible for 70 percent of total greenhouses gas emission. Thus, urban energy consumption may cause to change the regional climatic conditions. However, it is not necessary that urbanization is always and everywhere responsible for environmental degradation. Azam and Khan used carbon emissions as proxy for environmental degradation concluded that the effect of urbanization on environmental degradation can be positive or negative. There is some evidence for negative relationship between urbanization and carbon emissions [25,26]. Tupy identified urbanization as a noble factor for improvement of environmental quality as result of high efficiency in resources consumption. Similarly, Effiong has observed that urbanization can help in enhancing environmental quality. On the other hand, some researchers noted that urban lifestyles are significantly affecting energy intensity [23,29,30] and Tupy opined that urbanization improves the public facilities. Thus, urbanization may lessen environmental degradation. Grossman and Krueger argued that trade liberalization may lead to lesser environmental damages because of two very important reasons. First, trade liberalization may leads to higher income levels and because of increase in the national wealth people may ask cleaner environment. Second, trade liberalization policies may encourage foreign direct investment and as a result modern technologies transfer to local economy. Thus, the production technique will put lesser pressure on environment as modern technologies are cleaner than older technologies. Nasir and Rehman argued that trade structure matters for the environmental quality of a country and found that trade had detrimental effects on the environment. Haq also endorse this argument that trade structure matters for the environment however; trade may improve the environmental quality if the traded commodities are environmental friendly. The effects of trade on environment can be explained on bases of scale, technique, and composite effects [2,10]. Scale effect is based on the argument that trade liberalization results in extensive depletion of resources for more production thus; enhances carbon emissions. Whereas, technique effect of trade refers to diffusion of technology among countries and production is made environment friendly through efficient technologies. Moreover, trade enhances domestic competition so that domestic producers focus on efficient production techniques. Lastly, the composition effect refers to the composition of exports and imports. If a country trade surpasses in cleaner industries then trade will decrease emissions level and dirty industries dominate in trade then, trade will deteriorate the environment. Thus, whether trade improves or deteriorates environment is not settled in the literature [1,2]. Sri Lanka is a lower-middle income developing island of 21 million people, located in the south-eastern part of the southern tip of the Indian subcontinent. As a country, Sri Lanka was the first South Asian nation to liberalize its trade and investment regime in 1978. Trade openness which is the ratio of foreign trade to GDP is depicted in Figure 1 for the selected South Asian countries. Since 1978 to 2008, if one compares the Sri Lankan economy with other major economies of South Asia the ratio of trade to GDP is very high for Sri Lanka. However, the trade openness of Sri Lanka is fluctuation around 50% since 2009. Energies 2019, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 16 carbon emissions.

As a country, Sri Lanka was the first South Asian nation to liberalize its trade and investment regime in 1978. Trade openness which is the ratio of foreign trade to GDP is depicted in Figure 1 for the selected South Asian countries.

However, the trade openness of Sri Lanka is fluctuation around 50% since 2009. In 2016, the total worth of the Sri Lankan economy was US$ 83 billion with per capita income US$ 3835. The main sectors of the economy are inbound tourism, tea export, textile and apparel products, rice and other agricultural products. However, it is becoming knowledge-based economy as Sri Lanka has produced the second largest number of chartered accountants in the world. The country's significant successes in human development are well known. However, it has still been recognized as a transitional economy by the academics and policymakers. Also, according to United Nations assessment, Sri Lanka is known as one of the least urbanized countries in the world. About 81. 7% of the population of the country still lives in rural and plantation areas based on agricultural and agri-base related industry. Accordingly, the social and living condition of peoples is also significantly different between rural and urban areas in Sri Lanka. Figure 2 displays the urban population scenario in the selected South Asian countries. The percentage of urban population is continuously increasing in Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan whereas Sri Lanka has witnessed a marginal decrease in its urban population. Sri Lankan urban population remained below 20% of total population between 1978 and 2014. The statistics show that percentage of urban population of the country has marginally dropped in last three decades. According to the Asian population estimation of United nations, it is expected that in 2050, Asia is estimated to reach to at least 60% urban population. However, Sri Lanka is estimated to remain less than 40% urban population. Geographically, Sri Lanka is identified as Small Island with the tropical climatic condition. The official statistics indicate that global warming and climate change is taking place in the country in term of rainfall inconsistency and rising temperature. The environmental degradation in terms of carbon emissions situation is being portrayed in the selected South Asian countries in Figure 3.

The official statistics indicate that global warming and climate change is taking place in the country in term of rainfall inconsistency and rising temperature. The environmental degradation in terms of carbon emissions situation is being portrayed in the selected South Asian countries in Figure 3. Carbon emission per capita in Sri Lanka is higher than in Bangladesh over period from 1978 to 2014. This figure for Sri Lankan economy is reached to the level of carbon emissions in Pakistan in 2014. The carbon emissions continuously aggravated from 1993 to 2004 and from 2008 to 2014 for Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has recently been increasingly affected by different natural hazards. The level of carbon emission in the country is continuously rising which is one of the indicator of environmental degradation. Thus, in order to tackle environmental degradation, Sri Lanka national environmental action plan 1992-1996 was executed to establish an environmental protection plan within the context of development. Importantly, this national environmental action plan comprises of both corrective and preventive measures in areas such as industry pollution, energy, water and land resources, urban pollution, water and land resources, bio-diversity and wildlife, coastal resources, education and culture. However, despite of such plan, environmental degradation in the country has come to a peak as result of various socio-economic activities. Therefore, environmental issues in Sri Lanka need attention from the researchers. Although some studies are carried in the past in this regard, for example, in a study, Uddin, Badisha and Ozturk determined the effect of economic growth and energy consumption on carbon emissions in Sri Lanka. Likewise, the study of Gamage determined the impact of tourism development on carbon emissions along with energy in Sri Lanka. However, no study investigated yet the impact of urbanization and trade on carbon emissions in Sri Lanka. On the other hand, no similar study is found about the same phenomena in a context of island Sri Lanka has recently been increasingly affected by different natural hazards.

On the other hand, no similar study is found about the same phenomena in a context of island transitional economy where urbanization is a comparatively small proportion of the population in liberalized economic settings. Moreover, no study so far applied bounds tests with unknown structural break in case of Sri Lanka. Hence, this analysis is carried out to fill this gap in energy economics literature. Therefore, the main objective of this analysis is to explore the nexus between energy, trade, urbanization and environmental degradation in Sri Lanka. The rest of this report is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a literature review on the relationship between urbanization, trade, energy consumption and carbon emissions. Section 3 describes empirical model of the study, data, estimation strategy, and methods applied in the study. Empirical results are discussed in Section 4 of the study. Section 5 presents a discussion on the results of the study and Section 6 concludes the study and presents policy implications. The nexus between economic growth and environmental degradation has been studied in the theoretical framework of the EKC hypothesis. However, recent studies had mostly considered other relevant variables in the EKC framework. It is agreed that energy consumption is closely associated with economic growth and development. However, energy is not just responsible for the economic growth but it also garbs attention in the environmental economic literature as it may harm the environment. Thus, some of the studies analysed the casual relationship between energy, economic growth and carbon emissions. For instance, Soytas, Sari and Enwing argued that energy consumption has some policy implication especially in mitigating environmental degradation thus; to find out the exact relationship and to address omitted variables problem it is very important to add energy consumption in the economic growth-emissions nexus. They deduced that energy consumption had played vital role in environmental degradation instead of income level in the US. In a similar way, Uddin, Badisha and Ozturk studied the relationship between energy consumption, economic growth and carbon emissions in Sri Lanka. They considered carbon emissions as proxy for environmental degradation. The results of the study indicate there is long-term relationship among the studied variables and one-way causation is running from economic growth to energy consumption and carbon emissions. Obradovic and Lojanica carried out empirical study to examine the relationship between energy consumption, economic growth and carbon emissions in the case of Greece and Bulgaria. The results confirm no causality between energy consumption and growth in both Greece and Bulgaria in the short term; however, in the long term, causality runs from energy and carbon emission to GDP in both countries. Similarly, the study of Kais and Mbarek investigated the causal relationship between economic growth, carbon emissions, and energy consumption in three selected North African countries from 1980 to 2012. The results show a unidirectional causality from GDP to energy consumption and from GDP to carbon emissions. The results furthermore confirm that there is a considerable interdependence between energy consumption and GDP in the long term. However, the findings of Lee and Yoo study showed that there is a bidirectional relationship between economic growth and energy consumption and between energy consumption and carbon emissions while unidirectional causality runs from carbon emission to economic growth in Korea over the period from 1971 to 2008. Another recent study, Aye observed that economic development positively adds to carbon emissions in the high growth regimes while it indicates negative effect on carbon emissions in low growth regime. Besides, results of the study did not find the EKC hypothesis in 31 developing countries of Asia, Africa, and South America from 1971 to 2013. About the Sri Lanka case, Uddin examined the long term association between energy consumption, economic growth, and carbon emissions using time series data from 1971 to 2006. The study has applied Granger causality and Johansen co-integration analysis tests and established a long term causal relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth. Moreover, the results confirmed unidirectional causality running from growth to energy consumption and carbon emissions. The aforementioned studies discussed in this section showed that energy consumption has positive impact on carbon emissions, but this is not always true, as some of the studies found that energy has a negative impact on carbon emissions. The impact of urbanization on environment can be positive or negative. The urbanization process may increase the commercial energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions [13,14,43]. Using panel data for India, China, Indonesia, and Brazil from 1970 to 2012, the findings of a study by Alam revealed that there is a significant relationship between carbon emissions and population growth for India and Brazil, while it was statistically insignificant for Indonesia and China in both the short and long term. Some studies have studied the relationship between energy consumption, carbon emissions, economic growth and urbanization within a country-specific context. For China, Wang observed that urbanization level has a positive influence on carbon emissions in the western region, while urbanization did not significantly influence carbon emissions in eastern region, which has the most rapid urbanization development in China. In the context of time series analysis, Shahbaz analyzed the impact of urbanization on carbon emissions in the UAE. They applied the bounds testing approach in the presence of structural break. The results of the study showed that there is long-term relationship between economic growth, electricity consumption, urbanization and carbon emissions in the UAE. Moreover, this analysis concluded that electricity consumption has a negative impact on carbon emissions, whereas urbanization has a positive effect on carbon emissions in the UAE. Similarly, Katircioglu and Katircioglu examined the role of urbanization in environmental degradation for Turkey's economy. They considered urbanization impact on environmental degradation in the frame work of the EKC hypothesis. The results of the study indicated that rapid urbanization increases traditional energy consumption which positively affects carbon emissions. Also, the results of their study did not affirm the EKC hypothesis in Turkey. The study of Grossman and Krueger is considered a pioneering work on the effects of trade on the environment. Trade liberalization affects pollution level through three separate mechanisms in the local economy. First, trade liberalization leads to increase in the economic activity, and if there is no change in the production technique, then trade will lead to enhanced pollution in the local economy. This effect of trade on pollution can be referred as scale effect. Similarly, the second effect of trade liberalization is referred to as the composition effect. Economies specialize in those sectors in which they have a competitive advantage. Therefore, trade liberalization enhances the intensive use of its abundant factors and henceforth, the net effect of trade on environmental pollution in local economy depends on whether trade liberalization expand or contract pollution-intensive activities. Finally, the technique effect of trade liberalization is very important in the belief that trade liberalization policies will put less pressure on the environment. The reason for this is that because of such policies, the local economy will experience a change in the production techniques as modern technologies shift from developed economies to less developed economies because of relaxation in foreign investment. Thus, the generation of pollution per unit of production falls in less developed economies. Although trade is a vital determinant in the carbon emissions-energy-growth nexus, the question as to whether trade is beneficial for the environment or harmful to the environment is not settled in the empirical literature. The relationship among international trade, energy consumption, carbon emissions, and economic growth has involved many economics scientists. Some studies have observed that trade openness might help to combat global warming. The findings of the study conducted by Haq, Zhu and Shafiq concluded that trade leads to lower carbon emissions in Morocco; hence, trade is beneficial for the environment. Similarly, in the Singapore context, Zambrano-Monserrate recently verified the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis by applying the ARDL model for period 1971-2011. The results showed an inverted U-shaped relationship between income and carbon emissions in both long and short term. Also, energy consumption has sound effects on carbon emissions in the long-run. The Granger causality test established that trade openness helps to reduce carbon emissions. There are some empirical studies whose results confirmed that trade is damaging the environment as it is responsible for increase in the carbon emissions. For instance, the study of Nasir and Reheman confirmed that trade leads to increase in carbon emissions; thus, trade is responsible for environmental degradation in Pakistan. The findings of a study by Murad and Mazumder confirm that there is no evidence of an inverted U-shaped EKC hypothesis for Malaysia. However, trade is damaging the environment. For Tunisia, Chebbi observed the association between income, trade openness, and carbon emissions by using the cointegration test. The results of the study confirmed that trade positively contributed to carbon emissions not only in the long term, but in the short term as well. Also, as observed in the study of Nguyen , trade openness is a crucial factor of carbon emissions-energy-growth in China, but it does not provide evidence for the Indian economy. This analysis developed an empirical model closely following research performed by Nasir and Rehman , Haq , Gamage , Katircioglu and Katircioglu and Uddin. The study carried out by Uddin determined the effect of energy and economic growth on carbon emissions while the study conducted by Gamage examined the effects of energy along with tourism on carbon emissions in Sri Lanka. Trade as a potential determinant of carbon emissions was treated in the studies of Nasir and Rehman and Haq , whereas Katircioglu and Katircioglu examined the effect of urbanization on carbon emissions in the EKC hypothesis context. Thus, the following model was developed for our empirical analysis:The empirical model of the study implies that carbon emissions (CEP) are the function of energy consumption per capita (EC), per capita (PC), per capita squares (PC2), trade openness (TO) and urbanization (URB) in Sri Lanka. The model in Equation (1) can be rewritten in log-form as follows in Equation (2): In this analysis, carbon emission (metric tons) per capita is used as a proxy for environmental degradation in Sri Lanka. Energy consumption is proxied by energy consumption per capita (kg of oil equivalent per capita), while income level is proxied by real GDP per capita. Trade openness is measured as the ratio of the exports plus imports to GDP. Urban population is used as a proxy for urbanization. Data on all these variables were gathered from World Development Indicators, World Bank online database. The period of the data is from 1978 to 2014. This is time series data, so the variables of the study have to be tested for the unit root, as time series data usually carries the unit root. However, we will apply the Zivot-Andrew (ZA) unit root test instead of conventional unit root tests such as Augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test and Phillips-Perron test , as ZA also detects unknown structural break. Once the unit root properties of the time series data have been identified, along with structural break, we employ autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) to determine the cointegration in the time series. This test also acts as a bounds test. This model was developed by Pesaran , and is a combination of autoregressive and distributed lag models. The great advantage of this model compared to other cointegration techniques is that it can be applied irrespective of the order of integration of the variables. Hence, it is not essential whether variables are integrated of order I (0) or I (1). However, it cannot be applied if variables are integrated of higher order than I (1). Correspondingly, the dependent variable has to be integrated of I (1), and for the rest of the variables, it does not matter whether their order of integration is I (0) or I (1), or combination of I (0) and I (1). This test has lower and upper bounds for critical values of F-statistics; if the computed F-statistic is greater than the upper bounds, then the corresponding model is cointegrated. The ARDL model for the current study in the presence of structural break can be written as in the following Equations:where Dummy (D i ) represents unknown structural break and u t presents the disturbance term in each equation. The null hypothesis has to be tested (g 1 = g 2 = g 3 = g 4 = g 5 = 0) that there is no long-term relationship among the variables against the alternative hypothesis (g 1 g 2 g 3 g 4 g 5 0, which confirms the long-term relationship. Ordinary least squares (OLS) gives biased estimates if regressors are integrated of order one. However, we have fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS), which is suitable in such cases when variables become stationary on first difference and variables of the study are cointegrated. This was developed by Phillips and Hansen. This technique has several advantages over other cointegration techniques. This technique provides estimates free from the problems of endogeneity and autocorrelation, so the estimates are efficient and unbiased. For the classical polynomial regression, the OLS estimates are consistent but have a second-order bias. To overcome this problem, a fully modified OLS (FM-OLS) estimation is suggested. For this purpose, the considered dependent variable under this technique is modified in the following way:vvovv and y + = y + 1 , y + 2 ,. . . , y + T It is assumed that v 1 is known in advance and in applications of x 1 , x 2 ,. . . , x T only v 2 ,. . . , v T will be computed, where t = 2, 3,. . . , T. The unit root properties of all the time series are given in Table 1. The third and last column represent the structural break in the respective series. The determination of structural break in the time series is very important for accurate evaluation of any plan intended to bring about structural change in the economy. For instance, if we consider the structural break of carbon emissions, energy and urbanization, then it seems that the Sri Lanka national environmental action plan 1992-1996 is responsible for these structural breaks. The aim of this plan was to establish an environmental protection plan within the context of development. This plan provides the guidelines for specific actions in those sectors which pollute the environment. Importantly, this plan also provides guidelines for determining the required time frame and investment level needed in specific sectors to reduce environmental pollution. This national environmental action plan comprises of both corrective and preventive measures in areas such as industry pollution, energy, water and land resources, urban pollution, water and land resources, bio-diversity and wildlife, coastal resources, education and culture. The results of the ZA unit root test show that all variables are non-stationary at level and become free from non-stationarity at their first difference. It can be deduced from these results that none of the variables are integrated of higher orders than one. Thus, we can apply a bounds test of cointegration with structural break. The results of the bounds cointegration test with respective structural break is given in Table 2. This test confirmed that there are five cointegration vectors, as the calculated F-statistic of the bounds test is greater than the upper critical value. One can claim on the basis of these results that the variables of the study are cointegrated in the long term and were in a long-term relationship over the period of the study. Therefore, we can proceed to cointegration technique to obtain long-run estimates for the specified empirical model of the study. Once it had been confirmed that variables of the empirical model of the study are cointegrated in the long term, we applied the FMOLS for the long-term estimates. The results of FMOLS are given in Table 3. All the explanatory variables are significant. Energy consumption was found to be significant, with a positive effect on carbon emissions. Hence, energy consumption deteriorated the environmental degradation in Sri Lanka during the study period. The coefficient of per capita income is negative and significant, while the coefficient of per capita squares is positive and significant; thus, there is U-shaped relationship existing between environmental degradation and income level in Sri Lanka. Therefore, it is deduced that the EKC hypothesis does not prevail in Sri Lanka. Trade openness positively contributed to carbon emissions, as its coefficient was significant with a positive sign. Therefore, foreign trade in Sri Lanka is not environmentally friendly. The results regarding urbanization in Sri Lanka are very interesting, as urbanization was significant with a negative sign. This finding of the study shows that urbanization in Sri Lanka is not responsible for the accumulation of carbon emissions. Thus, urbanization does not aggravate environmental degradation. The results of the error correction model (ECM) are presented in Table 4. Energy consumption had a significant and positive effect on carbon emissions, like in the long term. Thus, energy consumption does not just contribute to environmental degradation in the long term, but in the short term as well. The coefficient of per capita income and its squares are insignificant in the short term; thus, the EKC hypothesis does not even prevail in the short term in Sri Lanka. Trade openness came out with a significant negative effect on carbon emissions; therefore, foreign trade does not hurt environmental quality in the short term. The coefficient of error correction term is negative and significant, which suggests that the model is in equilibrium and the model will get back into equilibrium from any external shock in less than two years. This analysis found a long-term relationship among carbon emissions, energy consumption, income level, trade openness and urbanization in the long term in Sri Lanka. The results of this analysis show that energy consumption aggravated the environmental degradation in Sri Lanka during the study period. Our results concerning energy consumption are consistent with earlier studies, for instance, the study of Gamage , who also found a significant positive effect of energy consumption on environmental degradation in Sri Lanka. The energy from fossil fuel was 27% in 1978 compared to 50% in 2014; thus, energy from fossil fuels has increased. The share of coal in total energy was negligible in 1990, whereas its share reached almost 10% in 2014. Similarly, Sri Lanka experienced an increase of coal share in electricity generation from 9% to above 25% during 2011-2014. The share of renewable energy in total energy consumption was slightly above 78% in 1990, whereas this share remained around 57% in 2014. This means that Sri Lanka experienced a decrease in energy from renewable resources, and as a result, energy in Sri Lanka is responsible for environmental degradation. Sri Lanka can upset the effect of energy from non-renewable resources by increasing the share of energy from renewable resources. Sri Lanka is among the most ideal settings for hydropower in South Asia. The country's electricity generation is mainly dependent on hydropower. The government is targeting an energy self-sufficient country by 2030. However, climate change has had an adverse effect on the hydroelectricity generation capacity of the country in recent years. Sri Lanka, a tropical nation, is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Thus, policymakers of the country have to consider the concept of the Green Economy as a key strategy to tackle the hazards of climate change. The results of this analysis revealed that the EKC hypothesis does not prevail in Sri Lanka in the long term or in the short term. This means that the Sri Lankan economy did not reach the income level beyond which further increase in income level results in a lower level of carbon emissions. This implies that increase in income level is not followed by a lower level of emissions. This finding of the study is consistent with earlier research studies, such as Gamage , whose study also did not confirm the EKC hypothesis in Sri Lanka. Our results are also consistent with the findings of Haq , whose study did not confirm the EKC hypothesis in Morocco. The results of this analysis show that trade openness contributes to environmental degradation in the long term. This result is consistent with Cole and Nasir and Rehman. The main sectors of the Sri Lankan economy are tourism, tea export, textile and apparel products, rice and other agricultural products. However, the positive impact of trade on environmental degradation can be on the basis of scale, technique and the composite effects of trade. The scale effect might enhance carbon emissions, as greater exports expand the economic size of the country. This further explains that domestic investors in Sri Lanka did not use environment friendly technology. Additionally, imported technology in the form of machinery is not environmentally friendly. This indicates that Sri Lankan foreign trade is not environmentally friendly, but we are not sure whether this is due to the exports of the country, or if imports are responsible for this positive impact on environmental degradation, so it is recommended to consider exports and imports as factors of environmental degradation in future studies. The results of this analysis indicated that urbanization does not lead to environmental degradation in Sri Lanka, as the coefficient of urbanization is significantly negative. This result of the study is consistent with Fan and Sharma , who found a negative correlation between urbanization and carbon emissions in developing countries. Similarly, Hossain also confirmed that urbanization has a negative effect on carbon emissions in the long term. This conclusion of the study also supports the ideas of Capello and Camagni and Tupy , who argued that urbanization leads to lower environmental damage in society, as it improves the public facilities. Another reason for this finding is the fact that there has been a decrease in the percentage of the urban population in Sri Lanka in the last two decades. Additionally, Sri Lanka has tropical climate conditions; thus, urbanization may not intensify the energy consumption, as urbanization does not lead to the accumulation of carbon emissions in the atmosphere of the Small Island. Another fact about the negative association between urbanization and carbon emissions is that the human development index in Sri Lanka is high as compared to the South Asian region. This means that the Sri Lankan government is being successful in providing necessities even in rural areas, resulting in a less urbanized population. Sri Lanka has recently been increasingly affected by different natural hazards. The level of carbon emission in the country is continuously rising, which is one of the indicators of environmental degradation. Thus, in order to tackle environmental degradation, the Sri Lanka national environmental action plan 1992-1996 was executed to establish an environmental protection plan within the context of development. Importantly, this national environmental action plan consists of both corrective and preventive measures in areas such as industry pollution, energy, water and land resources, urban pollution, water and land resources, bio-diversity and wildlife, coastal resources, education and culture. However, in spite of the existence of such a plan, environmental degradation in the country has come to a peak as a result of various socio-economic activities. Therefore, environmental issues in Sri Lanka need attention from researchers. This analysis was conducted to examine the nexus between energy, trade, urbanization and environmental degradation in the context of the EKC hypothesis for Sri Lanka. For this purpose, we analyzed the time series data, and the unit root problem was checked, along with structural breaks. The long-term relationship was determined through the bounds testing approach, among the variables of the study. This analysis found that energy positively contributed to carbon emissions, so it is among the leading causes of environmental degradation in Sri Lanka. The results show that there was a U-shaped relationship between income and environmental degradation, opposite to what the EKC hypothesis would present. This means that the Sri Lankan economy is achieving economic growth at the expense of extensive use of resources, thereby depleting the natural environment. The results show that foreign trade contributes positively to environmental degradation, as it has positive and significant effect on carbon emissions. The long-term estimates regarding urbanization show that urbanization is not responsible for the emissions of carbon in the environment; instead, its effect on environmental degradation is negative. This finding proves that urbanization is not harmful for the environment in Sri Lanka and supports the idea that urbanization brings efficiency in public facilities such as public transport and electricity. Another reason for the negative effect of urbanization on carbon emissions is that under the Sri Lanka national environmental action plan 1992-1996, the government affirms the concerns regarding urban pollution and energy use, along with water and land use. Therefore, the government reserved the forest area, and hence, urbanization was marginally reduced over the period in Sri Lanka. Steps are required from the government to ensure the present behavior of the people in urban areas, especially regarding energy consumption and construction under which they have to keep open areas for plantation. Also, the government has to ensure energy efficiency in urban development in future. Strict measures should be taken to make the production process environmentally friendly. Additionally, the government has to move forward towards the green economy concept. Awareness of the masses through media and encouraging conferences about sustainable development will help the government to adopt the concept of green economy. Similarly, the government can ensure sustainability goals through nurturing cooperation between private and public sectors by sharing information on financing strategies for energy-saving technology transfer processes. This analysis recommends adopting the measures required to make trade beneficial for the environment. This is only possible by implementing environmentally friendly measures in domestic production processes and taking measures to make imports more environmentally friendly. It is suggested for future research that, in order to understand the relationship between environmental degradation and urbanization in Sri Lanka, other important variables such as household size and population density be considered in this nexus. \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26949,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" david findley was born in washington , dc on december 27 , 1940 . after attending high school in lyndon , kentucky , he earned a b.s . \\n ( 1962 ) and m.a . \\n ( 1963 ) in mathematics from the university of cincinnati . \\n he then lived in germany , studying functional analysis under gottfried kthe , obtaining a ph.d . from the university of frankfurt in 1967 . \\n returning to the united states , he served as a mathematics professor at the university of cincinnati until 1975 . having transitioned from pure mathematics to statistical time series analysis , findley took a new academic position at the university of tulsa , during which time he interacted frequently with the nearby research laboratories of major oil companies and consulted regularly for cities service oil company ( now citgo ) . in 1980 \\n he was invited to lead the seasonal adjustment research effort at the u.s . \\n census bureau , and eventually rose to be a senior mathematical statistician before his retirement in 2009 . in 1966 \\n he married mary virginia baker , and they currently live in washington , dc .    \\n david findley has published more than 40 journal articles and book chapters , as well as dozens of technical reports and conference proceedings , many of which are heavily cited and influential . \\n he has also published two edited volumes ( 1978 and 1981 ) that have had a substantial impact on the field of time series analysis . \\n numerous honors and awards have accrued to him , including asa fellow ( 1987 ) , the julius shiskin award ( 1996 ) and the u.s . \\n department of commerce gold medal ( 1997 ) .    \\n .        the initial conversation between david findley , scott holan and tucker mcelroy took place on july 13 , 2010 at the u.s . census bureau . \\n holan and mcelroy later obtained clarifications of certain points from david findley during the following year . \",\n          \"An online algorithm for cost-aware feature acquisition and prediction\",\n          \"Risk and Financial Management Capital Structure and Bank Profitability in Vietnam: A Quantile Regression Approach.
